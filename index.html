            <h3>11.1. Entire Agreement and Integration</h3>
            <p class="legal-text">These Terms, together with any documents expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitute the entire agreement between you and OrganizeAI with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise of that or any other right hereunder.</p>
            
            <h3>11.2. Severability and Reformation</h3>
            <p class="legal-text">If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace any invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision with a valid provision that approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid provision as closely as possible.</p>

Subject to the foregoing, these Terms shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p>
            
            <h3>11.4. Force Majeure Events</h3>
            <p class="legal-text">OrganizeAI shall not be liable or responsible to you, nor be deemed to have defaulted or breached these Terms, for any failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any provision of these Terms when and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by or results from acts or circumstances beyond the reasonable control of OrganizeAI, including, without limitation, acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, governmental actions, war, invasion or hostilities (whether war is declared or not), terrorist threats or acts, riot or other civil unrest, national emergency, revolution, insurrection, epidemic, pandemic, lockouts, strikes or other labor disputes (whether or not relating to either party's workforce), restraints or delays affecting carriers, inability or delay in obtaining supplies of adequate or suitable materials, materials or telecommunication breakdown, or power outage.</p>
